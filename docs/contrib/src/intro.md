# Introduction to Boa

Boa is an engine that implements the [ECMAScript Language Specification](spec), which is 
a fancy and technical to say that Boa is an ECMAScript/JavaScript Engine. 

Why not just say so? Well, the technicality of the above statement can matter, especially 
when reading and/or writing Boa's documentation. Ultimately, we adhere to the ECMAScript 
Specification wherever possible and test Boa against the ECMAScript test suite (Test262).
