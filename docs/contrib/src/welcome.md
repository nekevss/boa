# Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Boa! 

We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you're an experienced rustacean 
or a JavaScript lover looking to dive deeper into an ECMAScript/JavaScript 
Engine. Please see the below guidelines and happy coding!

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to Boa or its dependencies should be made in the form of GitHub
pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor
(someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the main tree or
given feedback for changes that would be required. All contributions should
follow this format.

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on
the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated
efforts from contributors on the same issue.

## Head over to issues!

Head over to [issues][issues] and check for "good first issue" labels to find
good tasks to start with. If you're looking to dive into the codebase, we hope 
this guide will help along the way. 

## Community

If you come across words or jargon that do not make sense, please feel free to 
ask or reach out on [Discord](discord)!
