## Setting up Rust

If you don't already have Rust installed [_rustup_][https://rustup.rs/] is the recommended tool to use. It will install Rust and allow you to switch between _nightly_, _stable_ and _beta_. You can also install additional components. In Linux, you can run:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then simply clone this project and `cargo build`.
